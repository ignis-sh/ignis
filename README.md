> The breaking changes tracker is available in [#60](https://github.com/linkfrg/ignis/issues/60)

## Getting started
See the [Documentation](https://linkfrg.github.io/ignis)

## Supported Desktops
- wlroots-based Wayland compositors (e.g., __Sway__) 
- __Hyprland__
- Smithay based compositors (e.g., __COSMIC__)
- __KDE Plasma__ on wayland

...and all other compositors that implement the Layer Shell protocol.

Ignis __is not supported__ on:
- GNOME Wayland
- X11

...because they don't support the Layer Shell protocol.

## Examples
* A simple bar, see [examples](./examples/bar)
